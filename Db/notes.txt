WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE
1. when you get things like a message need to store the id so then 
you will periodically make queries being like "hey did i get any new message?"
which means sending your chat id and the room name and getting all chats in that room with an id greater 
than that id

2. Cannot write your your messages directly cause what if another message came in that time? 
Will send it to the server and then get the message back
